1.  A virus is a type of malicious software that attaches itself to a legitimate program or file. When you run that program or open the file, the virus activates.  Difference Viruses need human action to spread, like opening a file or running a program. They can damage files, slow down your computer, or cause other problems. 

2. A worm is a type of malware that can replicate itself and spread to other computers without any help from users. - Difference Unlike viruses, worms do not need to attach to a program or file to spread. They move through networks on their own, often causing network congestion and other issues. 

3.  A trojan is a type of malware that disguises itself as a legitimate or useful program to trick users into installing it.  Difference Trojans don't replicate themselves like viruses or worms. Instead, they rely on tricking users into installing them. Once installed, they can perform harmful actions like stealing information or allowing remote access to your computer.
