1. Know What You’re Looking At Logs are like a diary of what happened on your computer or network. Understand what each part of the log entry means. 

2. Spot the Usual Stuff Get familiar with what normal activity looks like. This could be regular logins, routine updates, etc. 

3. Find Weird Stuff  Look for anything that doesn’t fit the usual pattern – like lots of failed login attempts or strange IP addresses. 

4. Use Helpers Use software tools that help you search and make sense of the logs, so you don’t have to do it all manually. 

5. Connect the Dots  Sometimes, you need to look at logs from different sources to see the full picture. For example, if you see a weird login attempt, check if the same IP address tried anything else. 

6. Set Up Warnings Use tools to set alerts for unusual activities, so you get notified right away. 

7. Keep Notes Write down what you find and what you did about it
