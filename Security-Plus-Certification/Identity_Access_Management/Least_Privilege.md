 1. Think of RBAC like job roles at a company. Each job role (like manager, employee, intern) has specific tasks they can do. In RBAC, access to information or tools is given based on your role. So, if you're a manager, you get access to manager-level stuff.
 2. DAC is like having a personal safe. If you own the safe, you decide who else can open it. You can give keys to your friends or colleagues if you want. In DAC, the owner of the information decides who else can access it. 
 3. MAC is like a security system controlled by the buildingâ€™s security team. They decide who can enter different rooms based on strict rules. Even if you want to let someone into a restricted area, you can't unless the security team says it's okay. In MAC, access is controlled by a central authority based on strict policies.
