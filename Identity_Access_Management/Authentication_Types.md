 MFA means using more than one way to prove who you are before you can access something. For example, you might need to enter your password and then a code sent to your phone. This makes it harder for someone else to pretend to be you. 2. Biometrics: Biometrics are ways to identify you based on your unique physical features, like your fingerprint, face, or voice. Since these are unique to you, they are very secure ways to confirm your identity. 3. Tokens: Tokens are small devices or apps that give you a special code to use when logging in. This code changes every time, so even if someone steals the code, they can't use it later.
